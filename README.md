The Osoconn Project (c) 2021. The objective of the Osoconn Project is to develop a calculation repository of the various 
types of connection details used in the steel construction industry, and to make them available free of cost to the engineering 
community. This app is licensed under the MIT open-source license. The source code is available at Github.

The web app is available at https://osoconn.com/index.php.
